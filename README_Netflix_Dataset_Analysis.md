## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing Netflix’s dataset to uncover **trends and insights** about the platform’s content distribution, genres, ratings, countries, and release years. Using **Python’s data analysis and visualization libraries**, we explore how Netflix’s catalog has evolved over the years.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
The goal of this project is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Netflix dataset to identify:  
- Trends in **Movies vs TV Shows**  
- Most popular **genres and countries**  
- Distribution of **ratings**  
- Year-wise growth of Netflix content  

---

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Majority of Netflix content was added between **2015–2021**.  
- **Movies** dominate the platform, but TV shows are steadily increasing.  
- **Top contributing countries:** USA, India, and the UK.  
- Common content ratings include **TV-MA**, **TV-14**, and **PG-13**.  
- Popular genres include **Dramas**, **Comedies**, and **Documentaries**.

## 🧠 Technologies Used  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas** → Data cleaning & manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** → 2D data visualization  
- **Seaborn** → Statistical and aesthetic plotting  
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook** → Development environment

## ⚙️ Steps Performed  
1. **Importing libraries** and loading the dataset  
2. **Cleaning missing values** in `Country`, `Director`, and `Cast` columns  
3. **Converting date columns** and extracting year/month  
4. **Analyzing content types** (Movies vs TV Shows)  
5. **Genre analysis** using `Counter` and visualization  
6. **Country-wise contribution** using bar charts  
7. **Ratings distribution** with count plots  
8. **Yearly trend analysis** using line plots  
9. **Heatmap** showing genre popularity trends over the years  

---

## 📈 Visualizations  
- Bar charts for top genres and countries  
- Count plots for ratings  
- Line plot for movies vs TV shows over years  
- Heatmap for genre popularity over time  

*(All charts are generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn)*
